# Lab Report 5 Week 10
---
## Two tests where I had different answers:

1. [12.md](testfilesforreport5/12.md)

2. [142.md](testfilesforreport5/142.md)

---

I used the terminal command
```
diff lab9/markdown-parse/results.txt markdown-parse/results.txt
```
to find the tests with different results. The left is the other `markdown-parse` while the right is mine.

---

## Test for 12.md

The class implementation of `markdown-parse` produces the expected output, while my implementation does not.

Actual outputs (bottom is my output):

Expected output:
